# parallelStack
I have implemented [Parallel Thraed-Safe Stack](https://github.com/t0wbo2t/parallelStack/blob/main/parallelStack.cpp) for practice. I got the idea from "C++ concurrency in action" by Anthony Williams.
Instead of adding comments in the code, I have documented everything in [Explanation](https://github.com/t0wbo2t/parallelStack/blob/main/parallelStackExplanation.md) file.
